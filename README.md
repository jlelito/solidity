# Solidity Decentralized Applications
Repo for Practicing Solidity

This is the repo for practicing building decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain. Many of the projects use React.js and use a smart contract written in solidity for the backend.

So far these applications only run on local computer blockchains (Ganache) but I am currently working on getting the smart-contracts on the Ropsten Test Network (https://ropsten.etherscan.io/) so that everybody can try the apps for themselves.

To get test Ether from the Ropsten network just download Metamask here (https://metamask.io/) and get test Ether from the Ropsten faucet here (https://faucet.ropsten.be/).

Feel free to reach out if you have any ideas or want to help develop!
